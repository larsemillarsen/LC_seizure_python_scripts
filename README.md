# LC_seizure_python_scripts
 
Repository of python scripts used to process data and generate figures for the original research manuscript "Hippocampal seizures differentially modulate locus coeruleus activity and result in consistent time-locked release of noradrenaline in rat hippocampus" by Lars Emil Larsen, Sielke Caestecker, Latoya Stevens, Pieter van Mierlo, Evelien Carrette, Paul Boon, Kristl Vonck and Robrecht Raedt.

In order to run the scripts, data will need to be shared along with the python library 'vies', which is also available publicly via this github channel.

The followinging folder structure needs to be in place

Manuscript
  -  Data    (contains the data that is used to generate the figures, files too large to be uploaded here)
  -  LC_seizure_python_scripts     (scripts in this repository)
  -  vies   (https://github.com/larsemillarsen/vies)

Questions can be directed to larsemil88@gmail.com.
